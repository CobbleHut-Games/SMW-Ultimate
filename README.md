# SMW-Ultimate
Super Mario World Ultimate! The new adventure! Help Mario, Luigi, and their friends in Dinosaur Land! (Again!) After that there's another chapter! (SMW Encore Rom Hack)

This README is a work in progress, as Cally decides what actually happens. For now, it's just the SMW description.

After Bowser's previous defeat, Mario, Luigi, and Princess Toadstool decide to recuperate in Dinosaur Land. Meanwhile in Dinosaur Land, the Koopa King and his Koopalings trap Yoshi and his friends in enchanted eggs, eliminating the opposition as they secretly rebuild their forces. Shortly upon their arrival, the Mario Bros. realize that Princess Toadstool is missing. While searching, they find the Koopa Troop army. Upon the Mario Bros. freeing the friendly Yoshi, he exclaims that the Koopas have invaded, confirming that Toadstool's persistent captor has indeed returned and taken the opportunity to claim the princess.

As Mario and his friends travel through Dinosaur Land, they uncover the Valley of Bowser, where Bowser is fought on his castle roof in his Koopa Clown Car, holding Princess Toadstool hostage. Upon his defeat, he gently drops the princess and retreats. Princess Toadstool rewards Mario or Luigi with a kiss as fireworks celebrate freedom, signifying that their vacation can resume with their new good friends. The reunited team returns to Yoshi's House, where they and three other Yoshis watch the eggs hatch into babies, removing the spell.
